# Inkflow

Inkflow is an application that allows users to draw within the browser. Upon opening app, users are given the option to login or signup. Once logged-in, they will be taken to a homepage where they can enter their canvas by selecting (User)'s canvas above, they will be taken to an open canvas with brush settings on the right. They can also upload an image to the canvas and draw over it.

Another feature on the homepage is the ability to write drawing ideas and share them with other users.
